        She was top of her class at the IMC Military Academy and the only cadet who could take apart a Peacekeeper,
        equip it with a Precision Choke hop-up, and put it back together in under twenty seconds – blindfolded. \nThree
        years ago, Anita and her brother Jackson were ordered to retrieve a mercenary fleet from the Outlands to aid in
        the IMC\'s fight against the Militia. However, their unit lost contact with IMC HQ and were ambushed on arrival.
        The squad scattered, but Jackson stayed behind to give his sister time to escape. Alone and with no way home,
        Anita put her training, extensive weapon knowledge, and competitive spirit to work by joining the Apex Games.

        rumors: they are fabulously wealthy, a bloodthirsty murderer, a Goliath whisperer, a former slave, half bat, and
        a dozen other things depending on who\'s doing the whispering. \nAll anyone truly knows is that Bloodhound is a
        force to be reckoned with in the Apex Games. Bloodhound\'s unparalleled tracking skills are a boon to any team
        they join, helping them root out hidden opponents and tracking the enemy\'s movements. Calling on Earth\'s Old

        Frontier colonies’ crops, Humbert Labs was constantly on the hunt for better and stronger formulas. Nox was one
        of their brightest scientists and worked day and night developing new gases. But to make sure they worked, he
        needed to test them on more than just inert tissue: he needed something living. As he toiled in secret, Nox
        began to see the beauty in his creations and their ability to destroy anything they touched. But the head of
        Humbert Labs soon discovered his gruesome experiments, and their confrontation ended with the lab in flames and

        sacrifice and has devoted his life to helping those in need. \nThe Apex Games didn\'t change that, but they
        changed what it meant. Many of Gibraltar\'s friends and colleagues have competed in the Games for extra money,
        fame, and glory over the years, and some never came home. Gibraltar joined to keep them safe and, for the first

        he could about them. Even when his brothers went MIA during the Frontier War, Mirage and his mother continued to
        develop holo devices, and the work brought them closer. \nWhile working as a bartender to make ends meet, Mirage
        heard amazing stories from his patrons about the Apex Games and the wealth and glory that came with victory. As
        good as both of those sounded, he knew he couldn\'t risk leaving his mother childless – until she gave him a set

        he\'s never given up hope, and has joined the Apex Games to gain a following—and hopefully draw the attention of
